Javascript

It would definitely be to my advantage if I could get further than the basics in JavaScript, so away we go!

I'd eventually like to get into using Node.js, or Vue.js, etc. These frameworks will allow me to venture into the webpage realm of coding and even the visualization. With this I hope to absorb some HTML and CSS coding as well.

But like anything in life, one must learn to crawl before learning to web-crawl... :/ bad joke

To begin a rudimentary "webpage" a simple ```.html``` file is necessary. Once the file has been created, it can be accessed locally in you web browser.

The only things necessary for the file to work are:

```
<!doctype html>
```
call in the first line

and
```
<html>
text
</html>
```

That's it! Check out the
```
basic_html.html
```
file here: https://github.com/MethaneRain/JavaScript/blob/master/basic_html.html
