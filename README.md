Javascript

It would definitely be to my advantage if I could get further than the basics in JavaScript, so away we go!

I'd eventually like to get into using Node.js, or Vue.js, etc. These frameworks will allow me to venture into the webpage realm of coding and even the visualization. With this I hope to absorb some HTML and CSS coding as well.
